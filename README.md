# Module 6 - Letterheaded Paper

## Overview

This project includes a custom designed letter with some small custom elements. This paper follows all of the guidelines described in the Project brief except for
one part in which the I couldnt get the code to work correctly and display the seperate pages. The seperate pages are still styled and have also been customized to
look similar to the Lorem Ipsum site and its seperate html pages.
